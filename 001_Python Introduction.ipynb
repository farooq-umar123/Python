    "## What is Python ?\n",
    "- Python is a programming language that is widely used in web applications, software development, data science, and machine learning (ML).\n",
    "- Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together."

    "## History of Python:\n",
    "- Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was initially designed by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and developed by Python Software Foundation. It was mainly developed to emphasize code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Who Invented Python?_\n",
    "- In the late 1980s, history was about to be written. It was that time when working on Python started. Soon after that, Guido Van Rossum began doing its application-based work in December of 1989 at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) which is situated in the Netherlands. It was started as a hobby project because he was looking for an interesting project to keep him occupied during Christmas.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Why Python called Python?_\n",
    "- The inspiration for the name came from the BBC’s TV Show – __‘ Monty Python’s Flying Circus’__ , as he was a big fan of the TV show and also he wanted a short, unique and slightly mysterious name for his invention and hence he named it Python! He was the “Benevolent dictator for life” (BDFL) until he stepped down from the position as the leader on 12th July 2018.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### _Evolution of Python:_\n",
    "- The language was finally released in 1991. When it was released, it used a lot fewer codes to express the concepts, when we compare it with Java , C++ & C . Its design philosophy was quite good too. Its main objective is to provide code readability and advanced developer productivity. When it was released, it had more than enough capability to provide classes with inheritance, several core data types of exception handling and functions."
